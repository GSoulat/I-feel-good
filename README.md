# I-feel-good.. L'application du bonheur

# What is it?
This repository contains :
- a **[machine learning model](#the-model)**, trained to predict the category of texts from the diaries of the patients of coach Mr. Zen, our client.
- an **[app](#the-application)** (streamlit) who serves as a graphical interface for the model, and it's an application dedicated to Mr Zen's patients


# The model
>The model we are using is [Keras](https://keras.io/guides/).
Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.

Keras is:

> - Simple -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive load to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
> - Flexible -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily advanced workflows should be possible via a clear path that builds upon what you've already learned.
> - Powerful -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, and Waymo.


We also tried other models that we ended up not using, such as:
- TextHero and FastText
- Scikit-learn

## Features
The model needs **6** parameters in order to make a prediction:
- 
- 
- 


# The application
The application was made using **streamlit** in order to have a simple but good result while **saving development time**.

The **goal** of this application is **to provide easier predictions** to the user, M.Zen. which predicts whether the writings of Mr. Zen's patients fall into the following categories :
- Happy 
- Sadness
- Love 
- Anger
- Fear
- Surprise
